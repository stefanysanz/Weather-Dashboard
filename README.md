06 Weather Dashboard 

 This weather dashboard allows a user to look up a city's weather forecast, displaying the current weather (at the user's local time) and a 5-Day forecast. The user must enter the full city name and state name into the prompt. For the current forecast, the user is given the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. For the 5-Day forecast, the user is just given the temperature and the humidity. Information is displayed with imperial units because the U.S. is still one of only three countries which has not adopted the metric system. The user can allow the web page to gain access to their current location to display their relevant weather forecast as well.
